# Checkout Take-Home challenge

This is a primary documentation for the task, outlined in [this pdf](./Checkout.com%20Challenge.pdf)

## Assumptions and shortcuts

### Git

1. As it is a rather ubiquitous in software development, deliverables for the task was decided to be 
sent via a link to a private git repository. There are no limitations placed by the author on usage 
of the link or code in this repository, Checkout Ltd may use the link or the code in this repository 
in any way according to [MIT license](./LICENSE.md)

2. I tried to follow realistic practices when it comes to commits content and messages, but skipped 
everything related to branch management. In a real project, I would likely use either [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
or the accepted branching model in an organization

3. In addition to standard git, this repository uses [git Large File Storage (lfs)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) 
extension for pdf file with the task. This is, of course, primarily for a demonstration and not for a real benefit.
